    content: "Below the YouTube video, I've provided a detailed explanation on how to use the GitHub GistViewer npm package. Additionally, a comprehensive README file is included to guide you through the process. I've developed the vite-gist package, a powerful and flexible Gist viewer component for React applications. Simply install the package, import the vite-gist component, and follow the instructions provided here or in the npm package documentation to integrate it into your project. This package stands out due to its advanced features. I couldn't find any existing solution that met my needs, so I built this from scratch. With vite-gist, you're free to fully customize the appearance of the Gist viewer, including support for both light and dark modes. It also offers a font resizing option for an enhanced user experience. Whether you're looking for flexibility or ease of use, this package provides a comprehensive solution for embedding and customizing GitHub Gists in your React apps.",
